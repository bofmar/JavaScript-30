# Loacal Storage and event delegation

A tutorial on how to store info on user's local storage and how to handle event delegation.

We create a page where the user can add items in an unordered list. The user can click on the items to denote that they are done, or click on them again to mark them as undone. The list persists after the user reloads the page.
