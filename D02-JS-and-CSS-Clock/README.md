JS and CSS Clock
*****************

Specifications
***************
    Create a clock that shows the current time to the user.


Method
******
    We create an instance of the Date object.
    We use the instance's getSeconds, getMinutes and getHours methods to get the current time.
    We use those values to  turn the clock by converting them to degrees.
